# 🚀 About Me

I am a cybersecurity specialist and ICT engineer with a strong foundation in network security, cryptographic systems, and emerging technologies. With over five years of experience in the fields of information and communication technology, I have applied my expertise across academic research, private sector initiatives, and national technology programs.

Throughout my career, I have been actively involved in high-impact research and development projects. I currently serve as a Research Assistant at the Electronics Research Institute (ERI), where I contribute to the design and implementation of advanced cryptographic solutions, particularly in the domain of post-quantum encryption and IoT security protocols. In parallel, I have participated in interdisciplinary research with the Egyptian Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences, where I supported cybersecurity assessments and protocol development for critical space-based technologies and infrastructure.

My academic background includes a professional Bachelor’s degree in Information and Communication Technology with a specialization in networks. I am currently pursuing further postgraduate studies focused on cybercrime investigations, quantum cryptography, and digital forensics.

My work has been recognized by national and international organizations including HackerOne, Almentor, and Egypt's leading research institutions. I am deeply committed to advancing cybersecurity education, promoting indigenous digital innovation, and supporting strategic collaborations that bridge research with real-world applications.
